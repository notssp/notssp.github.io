I'm Felipe(you can call me Moses if you will)   
Not much to talk about, I'm a plain simple guy   
I work as a software engineer in Brazil   
I enjoy listening to podcasts( politics and true crimes )    
Sad songs are my vibe.   
Usually, find myself in a _love hate love_ with IT   
A reminder:    
> Diligence is the mother of good luck.     

My Political views **are my own**.
