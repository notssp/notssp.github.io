As a non-native English speaker living in a non-English speaking country   
I need to constantly keep my English skills fresh and updated   
So I’ll post my English content transcription here on this blog   
Initially, it’ll be podcast’s content but it can be something else in the future That’s something not carved in stone    
In this segment, I’ll be practicing and improving my listening(main goal) and writing(secondary goal) skills   
How it will work?   
It’ll be a straight forward approach   
I’ll inform the podcast name, genre, season(if it applies), and episode number   
And the transcript, finally   
It might be necessary to split it into more than 1 post   
But I believe it will be as simple as I’ve explained
